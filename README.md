DESCRIPTION
============

The Teleportation Prototype demonstrates a design concept for a three-dimensional (3D) first-person navigation system. It is intended for use in virtual and augmented reality experiences. It features gesture-based input using the Leap Motion Controller.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

By default, the app will occupy the full screen. Two input modes are included and may be selected from the title screen. The Mouse mode makes use of the left and right mouse buttons only. The Leap Motion Controller mode requires a Leap Motion Controller and one free hand (left or right) to operate. Ensure that your Leap Motion Controller is functioning, calibrated, and in head-mounted position prior to starting. Press the ESC key from either mode to exit the app.

WARNING
============

This system has not been fully tested with virtual and augmented reality systems. Exercise caution when using this system with a head-mounted display (HMD). Any potentially adverse effects on users are currently unknown. This system would likely require additional testing and revision to be appropriate for end users.
